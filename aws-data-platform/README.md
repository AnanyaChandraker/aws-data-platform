# AWS Data Platform - Example Repository
This repository demonstrates a reference implementation for an enterprise AWS data platform using:
- Kinesis (real-time ingestion)
- AWS Lambda (processing)
- S3 (raw/processed/curated storage)
- EMR (batch PySpark processing)
- Glue (catalog + serverless ETL)
- MWAA (Airflow orchestration)
- Simple Data Quality (DQ) framework

**Structure**
See folder descriptions in the repository.

**Note**
This is a sample, instructional repository containing local scripts and configuration templates. It is intended for education and interview demonstration purposes — not production-ready without proper security, credentials handling, and AWS deployment steps.
